# Audio-Visualization

This is a project created for my Sensor Based Interaction class. It is created in Open Frameworks in C++

This code uses an Audio Analyser code that was provided, I did not code the AudioAnalyser file located in the src folder.

Using this to gather the volume, frequency and tone from an audio source, in this case the song [1612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRHQPG1xd9o) by Vulfpeck.

Using the gathered data I made particle effects pulse and move with the beat of the song, each color attributing to a different instrument.

A video of the result can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0-dpe_FU68)
